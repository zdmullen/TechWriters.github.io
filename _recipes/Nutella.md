Vegan Nutella

250g raw hazelnuts
80 ml unsweetened soy milk
1 Tbsp coconut oil
2 Tbsp maple syrup
6 soft dates
30g cocoa powder 
1 tsp pure vanilla extract 
1/4 tsp salt 
 
1.	Preheat the oven to 180 C. Spread the hazelnuts onto a cookie sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes. 
2.	Remove the hazelnuts from the oven and allow them to cool. 
3.	Rub the hazelnuts in a clean kitchen cloth. 
4.	Place the peeled hazelnuts in a high-speed blender or food processor and blend on high for 5 minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides, until a thin nut butter consistency is formed. 
5.	Add the remaining ingredients and blend again for an additional 3-5 minutes until the spread is smooth and well incorporated.
